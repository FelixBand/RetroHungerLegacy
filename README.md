### Mod Description:

This mod aims to take you back to the era of early alpha versions of Minecraft by simplifying the health and food system. The hunger bar is removed, and now health is instantly restored upon eating, just like it was in the old days. Each type of food restores a specific amount of health, and the food item is consumed immediately after eating.
